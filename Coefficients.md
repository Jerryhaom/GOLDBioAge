<p align="center"><strong>Coefficients for GOLD and Light BioAge </strong></p>

We independently fitted the GOLD and Light BioAge models to the NHANES and UKB datasets, with coefficients provided for each (**Table 1**). Similarly, benchmark models (KDM, PhenoAge) were developed within each dataset (NHANES and UKB, respectively). Additionally, we develop a Chinese population-specific version of Light BioAge (**Table 2**) using CHARLS 2011 and 2015 wave data, adjusted for population differences. This model is publicly available to enable further investigation of Light BioAge's relationship to other health factors, using the epidemiological data of CHARLS.

Due to its non-normal distribution, CRP was log-transformed. Log CRP was calculated as ln(CRP + 1). <br>
Note that CRP units differ: mg/dL in NHANES versus mg/L in UKB and CHARLS. For high-sensitivity CRP, we recommend using the UKB-derived coefficients.
